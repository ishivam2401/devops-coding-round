1.we have created two subnets 
Public and private 
The application is deployed in the public subnet and database is in private subnet .
2.to make the application highly available we have attached a auto scaling group and a application load balancer that will also 
perform health checks and mark the unhealthy instances. 
3. The security group attached to the rds will only allow inbound access to t2.xlarge.
4.We have choosen t2.xlarge inorder to handle large number of requests/seconds and provide low latency.
5.Rds will be providing automatic backups
